## Project Description
The aim was to create a daily planner for the busy person with multiple events through the day, to assist with time management and provide the function of moving events around to optimise their week.

## Functionality
WHEN the user opens the planner, the current day should be displayed at the top of the calendar.

WHEN the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours as well as a memo block below for occasions, reminders and ad-hoc notes.

WHEN the user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

WHEN the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event and click a save button to save event. The text for that event should then be saved in local storage.

WHEN the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.

## Actual Behaviour
WHEN the user opens the planner, the current day, date and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.
